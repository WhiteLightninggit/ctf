# Rock with the wired shark! (Misc, 70p)

```Sniffing traffic is fun. I saw a wired shark. Isn't that strange?```

As entry for this task we have **[pcapng](./dump.pcapng.gz)** file, and some poetry about wired shark... 

After standard checking, seems in fact its Wireshark file. Lets dig into.

![traffic](./wireshark.png)

And what's there? Some TCP traffic and few http GET's. So lets try what we can extract. We got:
* **flag.zip** (nice)
* **html with error** (not important)
* **html from screen below** - so we can see someone was getting flag.zip from that page 
![page](./page.png)

From those **flag.zip** looks most interesting. Its in fact zip archive containing **flag.txt**. Yay. But its also password protected. Buu.

_At this point I've lead myself astray (thinking task is harder, than it happened to be - judging by amount of points, not knowing those are at random:)._

_I was thinkig about bruteforcing this zip, but to do it in reasonable time, its good to have something more than archive itself. So I started to investigate code from here: http://seba-geek.de/stuff/servefile/ This link was in html file..._

_Bang! Dead End._

Lets go back to Wireshark. I've tried few tricks (without success off course). Than thought: lets look once more for **GET** requsts, maybe there is something interesting?

Yup. "azulcrema". Now all what has left, was to extract archive and enter flag.
